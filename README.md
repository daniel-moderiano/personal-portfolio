# Personal portfolio

This is the repository for [danielmoderiano.com](https://danielmoderiano.com), my personal website/portfolio. 

## About the project

This portfolio aims to showcase my best projects, tech stack, resume, and provide some contact information. The idea was to produce a minimalist, fast, performant portfolio with minimal overhead. The user should be able to access the main parts of the portfolio with as few clicks as possible.
